# How can I contribute?

  - Make sure to setup [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Git](https://git-scm.com/) during this step.

# How can I test my fork?
I have setup a testing bot with **very** limited permissions in the server for testing purposes. In your project folder create a file named `.env` and write the following line in it (use token from [this message](https://discord.com/channels/882719457963831377/882947607696121918/882960700035702834)): `TOKEN=TOKENFROMMESSAGE` and save the file. When you go to run your code (`node index.js`), the testing bot should come online and will be running your code on your computer.
